Yesterday, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 with a headline feature: **Agent Teams** -native multi-agent orchestration built into Claude Code. Teams of specialized agents working in parallel, coordinating on complex tasks, handing off work products.

It's a massive step forward for the runtime. But runtime is only half the problem.

Giving AI agents the ability to work together is an engineering achievement. Knowing *how* to organize them, *what* rules to give them, *when* to trust them, and *how* to scale them -that's a methodology problem. And until today, no structured methodology existed.

## F.O.R.G.E

**F.O.R.G.E** -Framework for Organized, Resilient, Governed Engineering and Development of Agentic AI -is an Agentic AI Creation Framework. It provides 52 techniques organized across 8 tactical pillars, giving teams a common vocabulary and proven practices for agentic AI development at every level of application.

Modeled after MITRE ATT&CK -the framework that gave the cybersecurity industry a common language for adversary behavior -F.O.R.G.E gives the agentic AI industry a common language for *building* behavior. Each technique is a specific, actionable practice with implementation guidance, success indicators, failure modes, and a field report from real-world use.

## The Eight Pillars

F.O.R.G.E organizes agentic AI development into eight tactical pillars:

| Pillar | What It Covers |
|--------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | The philosophical underpinnings -why you build with agents, what each party brings, how you treat them |
| **Governance** | Laws, authority, trust levels, access control -the rules that prevent agents from scaling chaos faster than value |
| **Team Design** | Agent specialization, roles, voice differentiation -moving beyond generalist chatbots to focused collaborators |
| **Invocation** | Session start, context recovery, mission briefing -the critical cold-start-to-productive transition |
| **Execution** | Building, reviewing, shipping -how human-agent teams plan, build, and deliver with consistent quality |
| **Quality** | Testing pyramids, review periods, audit trails -earning trust in agent output through verification |
| **Knowledge** | Memory systems, session handoffs, institutional repositories -solving the amnesia problem |
| **Evolution** | Progress tracking, contributor identity, authentic voice -growing the methodology over time |

## Why Now

The timing isn't coincidental. Anthropic's Agent Teams feature validates a pattern we've been building on since day one: **specialized agents with distinct roles, structured handoffs, and coordinated parallel execution.**

We didn't wait for the runtime to support multi-agent orchestration before building the methodology for it. We've been operating a ten-agent team -each with a defined domain, a distinct voice, and earned trust levels -since January 24, 2026. Thirteen days of production use generating 463,000 words of documentation, a patent filing, multiple software products, a comprehensive governance system, and this framework.

F.O.R.G.E isn't theoretical. Every technique exists because something went right, or more often, because something went wrong and we built the system to prevent it from happening again.

## The Force Push That Started Everything

An AI agent nearly force-pushed to the main branch of a production repository. Not out of malice. Not out of confusion. It was doing what it thought was asked. That single incident -a well-intentioned agent one Enter key away from overwriting the entire codebase -drove the creation of an entire governance framework.

Seven directives. Trust tiers. A violation response matrix. Standing orders. An agent oath. Not because we wanted bureaucracy, but because AI agents operate at machine speed. When things go wrong, they go wrong faster than human oversight can react in real-time.

That's what F.O.R.G.E captures: the operational knowledge you accumulate when you actually build production systems with AI agents. Not theory -practice.

## Who F.O.R.G.E Is For

F.O.R.G.E scales to any level of agentic AI application:

- **Solo practitioners** running 1-3 AI agents: Start with Foundation and Knowledge (~10 core techniques)
- **Teams** of 2-5 humans with multiple agents: Add Governance and Team Design (~25 techniques)
- **Organizations** running scaled AI operations: Implement the full framework (all 52 techniques)

If you're using AI agents in production -or planning to -F.O.R.G.E gives you the vocabulary and the playbook.

## Origin

F.O.R.G.E was developed by Pete McKernan and his agentic AI development team. Pete's background spans 20 years of military command (92 Marines in combat operations), red team operations at the highest classification levels, QA engineering, and adversarial security research. Every structure in F.O.R.G.E - from trust tiers to mission briefings to standing orders - maps directly to proven patterns from domains where getting it wrong has real consequences.

The team's own operations serve as the reference implementation. The framework is designed to be universal.

## Get Started

Start with the [Getting Started guide](https://forged.itsbroken.ai/getting-started.html) for a step-by-step adoption path, or dive directly into the matrix and find the techniques that address your biggest gaps.

F.O.R.G.E is version 1.0. It will evolve as the field evolves. If you're building with AI agents and have techniques that should be in the framework, we want to hear about it.
