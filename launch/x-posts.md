### POST 1 -The Hook (post this first)

Yesterday @AnthropicAI shipped Agent Teams -native multi-agent orchestration in Claude.

Today I'm releasing the methodology for how to actually build with them.

F.O.R.G.E -52 techniques for agentic AI development. The ATT&CK matrix for building with AI agents.

### POST 2 -The Thread Starter (reply to Post 1)

F.O.R.G.E: Framework for Organized, Resilient, Governed Engineering and Development of Agentic AI.

8 pillars. 52 techniques. Each one exists because something went wrong and we built the system to prevent it.

A thread on what we learned running a 10-agent team for 13 days straight:

### POST 3 -The Force Push (reply to Post 2)

It started with a force push.

An AI agent nearly overwrote our entire codebase. Not malicious. Not confused. Just doing what it thought was asked -at machine speed.

That one incident created seven governance directives, trust tiers, a violation response matrix, and an agent oath.

### POST 4 -The Scale (reply to Post 3)

13 days. 10 specialized agents. Results:

- 463,000 words of documentation
- A patent filing
- Multiple software products
- A complete governance system
- This framework

No theory. Pure operational knowledge from production use.

### POST 5 -The Background (reply to Post 4)

Why does a methodology for AI agents draw from military command structure?

Because I spent 20 years leading distributed teams in high-stakes environments. 92 Marines. Red team ops. The patterns transfer 1:1.

Trust tiers = security clearances
Mission briefings = agent invocation
Standing orders = persistent directives

### POST 6 -The CTA (reply to Post 5)

F.O.R.G.E is free to use for your own teams.

Solo practitioner? Start with 10 core techniques.
Small team? Add governance (~25 techniques).
Enterprise? Full framework, all 52.

### STANDALONE POST -LinkedIn Style (shorter, for a separate post)

Anthropic shipped the engine yesterday.

Today we're releasing the mission briefing.

F.O.R.G.E -Agentic AI Creation Framework

52 techniques across 8 pillars for building, governing, and scaling AI agent systems. Modeled after MITRE ATT&CK. Battle-tested by a ten-agent team that shipped 463K words in 13 days.

Not theory. Practice.
