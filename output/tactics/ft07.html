                <td>Maintain a structured, versioned record of project history including plans, decisions, and health metrics. The history system is more than a changelog - it is the institutional memory of the collaboration. It records not just what happened, but why decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and what the team learned. When context is lost (as it inevitably is in AI collaboration), the history system provides recovery.</td>

                <td>Define a structured format for transferring context between sessions. Every session end is a potential knowledge cliff - if context isn't captured, the next session starts from scratch. The Session Handoff Protocol creates a standardized 'shift change brief' that captures: what was accomplished, what's in progress, what decisions are pending, and what context the next session needs to continue seamlessly.</td>

                <td>Create a persistent, organized repository of institutional knowledge that survives session resets, model changes, and team transitions. The Repository is where the collaboration's accumulated knowledge lives permanently. It includes agent profiles, governance documents, operational procedures, and reference materials. Unlike session-specific context, the Repository's contents are always available and always current.</td>

                <td>Document significant decisions with their context, rationale, alternatives considered, and expected consequences. Decisions without documented rationale become mysterious over time - the team knows what was decided but not why, making it impossible to evaluate whether the decision is still appropriate. Decision Records preserve the thinking behind choices so they can be revisited intelligently.</td>

                <td>Systematically capture and preserve war stories, breakthroughs, failures, and journey documentation. The collaboration's story - the messy, real, human story of building with AI - is itself valuable content. Journey Preservation ensures that significant moments are captured in real-time: the bug that led to a governance overhaul, the breakthrough that unlocked a new capability, the failure that taught the most important lesson. The journey is the content.</td>

                <td>Implement multiple, independent backup mechanisms for all critical data and knowledge. In human-AI collaboration, context loss is the ever-present threat. A single backup is not a backup - it's a single point of failure. Redundant Backup Strategy ensures that critical knowledge exists in at least three independent locations, using at least two different mechanisms, with regular verification that backups are current and restorable.</td>

                <td>Strategic management of what information occupies the finite context window available to AI agents during a session. The context window is the single most important technical constraint in AI collaboration — it determines what the agent knows, what it has forgotten, and what it will hallucinate to fill gaps. Effective context window management prioritizes high-value information, removes stale context, and structures loading sequences to maximize signal-to-noise ratio within the available token budget.</td>
