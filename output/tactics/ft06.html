The Testing Pyramid applies traditional software testing principles to human-AI collaboration: unit-level validation of individual outputs, integration testing of combined outputs, system testing of complete deliverables, and acceptance testing against human expectations. More tests at the base, fewer at the top, comprehensive coverage throughout.</td>

                <td>Establish explicit standards for the quality of AI-generated code. AI agents can write code quickly, but quality requires explicit standards: read existing code before modifying it, follow established patterns, don't introduce new dependencies without justification, and test before committing. Code Quality Standards convert implicit expectations into explicit, enforceable rules that agents follow consistently.</td>

The Review Period is not about distrust - it is about calibration. New contributors need time to learn project conventions, and the team needs time to assess the contributor's quality, reliability, and alignment with project standards. The review period formalizes this mutual calibration.</td>

                <td>Test AI-generated artifacts across all target platforms, environments, and configurations. AI agents typically work in one environment but their output may need to function across many. Cross-Platform Validation ensures that output is tested in every context it will encounter, not just the development environment. This includes operating systems, browsers, screen sizes, accessibility tools, and deployment environments.</td>

When something goes wrong, the audit trail enables root cause analysis. When something goes right, it enables pattern replication. Every significant action should leave a mark in the record: who did it, what they did, why they did it, and when.</td>

                <td>Systematic methods for detecting inaccurate, fabricated, or misleading content in AI-generated output. AI agents produce output with high confidence regardless of accuracy — hallucinated facts, invented citations, plausible-sounding but incorrect technical claims, and subtly wrong data are indistinguishable from correct output without explicit verification. Output verification is not optional quality enhancement; it is the minimum standard for using AI-generated content in any context where accuracy matters.</td>
