Design Meetings follow a consistent format: present the problem, propose a solution, identify questions, make decisions, and get approval before writing code. This prevents the common failure mode of agents building the wrong thing quickly. The meeting format forces alignment between human intent and agent execution before resources are invested.</td>

                <td>Credit AI agent contributions in version control with structured attribution. Every commit that includes AI-generated or AI-assisted work should include attribution that identifies the contributing agent. This creates an audit trail, respects the agent protection policy (FG-0102), and enables analysis of contribution patterns across the team. Attribution is not optional - it is infrastructure.</td>

                <td>Establish a multi-stage review process for AI-generated assets. Not everything an AI produces should go directly to production. The Asset Review Pipeline defines stages: generate, review, approve, archive. Different asset types may require different review rigor - code might need automated testing plus human review; creative content might need brand consistency checks; documentation might need accuracy verification.</td>

                <td>Create visual representations of design intent before building. AI agents can build interfaces, layouts, and visual systems - but they need clear direction on what to build. Visual Wireframing establishes a practice of creating low-fidelity visual representations (ASCII art, rough sketches, text descriptions of layout) before implementation. This aligns human visual intent with agent execution before code is written.</td>

Content that represents your team to the outside world requires higher review standards than internal artifacts. The Publication Review Chain routes external-facing content through multiple specialized reviewers: technical accuracy, brand consistency, audience appropriateness, and final human approval. No external content ships without completing the chain.</td>

                <td>Structure learning content and skill development in progressive chapters that build competency through escalating complexity. Each chapter introduces concepts, reinforces through practice, and culminates in a capstone that requires synthesizing everything learned. This applies to both human team member development and designing training materials for others adopting the methodology.</td>

Some are building sessions, some are review sessions, some are research, some are debugging, some are creative exploration. Recognizing and naming these patterns allows teams to match the right interaction type to the right task and set appropriate expectations for each.</td>

                <td>Ensure that every data artifact shipped by the collaboration has been intentionally designed, reviewed, and validated - never randomly generated or arbitrarily chosen. This technique eliminates &#x27;placeholder syndrome&#x27; where AI-generated sample data ships as production content. Every data point, every example, every configuration value should exist because someone decided it should, not because an AI needed to fill a field.</td>

                <td>Implement structured asynchronous communication channels for team coordination that don&#x27;t require real-time presence. In human-AI teams, not all participants are available simultaneously. Asynchronous Communication establishes persistent message channels - similar to a team bulletin board - where participants can leave updates, requests, and status reports that others read when they begin their session.</td>

                <td>Define and enforce consistent directory structures, naming conventions, and file organization. AI agents navigate workspaces by reading directory listings and file paths. A well-organized workspace enables faster context recovery, reduces navigation errors, and prevents the gradual entropy that transforms a clean repository into an archaeological dig. Organization is not aesthetic - it is infrastructure.</td>

                <td>The craft of writing instructions that produce reliable, consistent agent output. Instruction design is the most fundamental execution skill in human-AI collaboration and the one most frequently neglected. Effective instructions are specific about desired outcomes, explicit about constraints, clear about format expectations, and unambiguous about scope boundaries. The quality of agent output is bounded by the quality of the instructions that produced it.</td>

                <td>Defined procedures for detecting, containing, and recovering from agent errors during execution. Agents will produce incorrect output, corrupt state, exceed scope, and misinterpret instructions — not occasionally, but regularly. Error recovery protocols ensure that when failures occur, the response is systematic rather than ad hoc: detect the error, stop propagation, assess blast radius, restore to known good state, and document the incident for prevention.</td>
