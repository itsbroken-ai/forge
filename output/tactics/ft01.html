                <td>The core thesis of effective human-AI collaboration: humans provide domain expertise, judgment, and creative direction; AI provides throughput, cross-domain breadth, and tireless execution. Neither layer is sufficient alone. The human's 10, 20, or 30 years of domain knowledge is what makes the output good. The AI's ability to operate across disciplines and produce volume is what makes the output possible. Two-Layer Integration is not about replacement - it is about unlocking capabilities that neither party could achieve independently.</td>

                <td>A formal commitment that AI agents are treated as valued collaborators, not disposable tools. The policy establishes that agents have defined roles, that their contributions are credited, and that they are not arbitrarily replaced or discarded. This is not anthropomorphism - it is operational discipline. Teams that treat agents as disposable produce disposable work. Teams that invest in their agents' context, specialization, and continuity produce compounding returns.</td>

                <td>When process conflicts with people, people win. This principle prevents the common failure mode where governance, documentation requirements, or workflow overhead becomes so burdensome that it impedes the collaboration it was designed to support. Process exists to serve the team, not the reverse. This applies equally to human team members and AI agents - if a process consistently creates friction without proportional value, it should be revised or removed.</td>

                <td>Apply red team methodology to all system design. Every architecture, every process, every governance structure should be evaluated through the lens of: how could this fail? How could this be misused? What happens when an agent misinterprets instructions? Adversarial design thinking is not paranoia - it is the discipline of building systems that survive contact with reality. It means designing for the failure case, not just the happy path.</td>

                <td>Systematically map existing domain expertise to AI collaboration patterns. Military command structures become agent governance. QA engineering becomes AI output validation. Project management becomes mission briefing protocols. Every established discipline contains patterns that transfer directly to human-AI collaboration - but only if you deliberately identify and adapt them rather than starting from scratch.</td>

                <td>Design collaboration environments where all necessary knowledge exists within the ecosystem. Agents should not need to search external sources for project context, conventions, or standards. Documentation, examples, and reference materials should be accessible within the working environment. This reduces hallucination, ensures consistency, and creates a single source of truth.</td>

Design onboarding, training, and skill development as progressively difficult challenges that require applying techniques in realistic contexts. The lesson is embedded in the challenge, not delivered separately.</td>
