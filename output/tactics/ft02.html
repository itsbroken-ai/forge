                <td>Define a clear, unambiguous hierarchy of authority. In any human-AI collaboration, there must be a single, identifiable authority who has final say on all decisions. This is not about control - it is about clarity. When an agent faces a decision that could have significant consequences, it must know exactly who has the authority to approve it. Authority Architecture eliminates the 'I thought you said it was okay' failure mode.</td>

                <td>Establish inviolable rules that govern all AI agent behavior. Operational Directives are not guidelines or best practices - they are laws. They define the boundaries that agents must not cross regardless of context, instruction, or perceived necessity. Good directives address real failure modes observed in practice, not hypothetical concerns. They should be few enough to memorize and clear enough to be unambiguous.</td>

Trust Tiers establish a graduated system where agents begin with limited access and earn expanded capabilities through demonstrated competence and reliability. This mirrors security clearance models: access is granted based on need and earned through trust, not assumed by default.</td>

                <td>Restrict access to sensitive information and operations on a need-to-know basis. Not every agent needs access to every repository, credential, or system. Compartmented Operations applies the intelligence community's principle of compartmentalization: information is shared only with those who need it for their specific role. This limits blast radius when things go wrong and prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data.</td>

                <td>Define escalating consequences for governance violations. Rules without consequences are suggestions. The Violation Response Matrix establishes a clear, graduated response system: from verbal correction for minor infractions to immediate suspension for critical violations. The goal is not punishment but predictability - agents and humans alike know exactly what happens when a boundary is crossed.</td>

                <td>Formalize expectations for all participants through explicit agreements. Every agent and human contributor should acknowledge the governance framework, their role boundaries, and their responsibilities before beginning work. Contributor Agreements are not bureaucratic overhead - they ensure that every participant enters the collaboration with aligned expectations and documented commitments.</td>

                <td>Plan for continuity when key participants become unavailable. What happens when the primary human lead is unavailable? What happens when a critical AI agent's model is deprecated? Succession Protocol ensures that the collaboration can continue operating - perhaps at reduced capacity - when key participants are absent. This is not pessimism; it is operational planning.</td>

AI agents operate at machine speed - they can create, modify, and delete faster than human oversight can follow in real-time. Security Operations establishes automated monitoring that watches for anomalous behavior, unauthorized access attempts, and policy violations. This is your SOC for human-AI collaboration.</td>

Ethical Data Boundaries establish clear policies about what information is collected, how it is stored, who has access, and when it is deleted. This is not just compliance - it is trust.</td>

                <td>Maintain persistent directives that remain in effect across all sessions. Standing Orders are instructions that don't need to be repeated every session - they are always active. They cover recurring requirements like commit message format, code style, documentation standards, and behavioral expectations. Standing Orders reduce session startup overhead and ensure consistency even when context is limited.</td>

                <td>Establish explicit constraints on token consumption, compute resources, and time allocation for AI agent operations. Without resource governance, agents optimize for output quality without regard for cost — executing unlimited iterations, spawning parallel processes, and consuming tokens at economically unsustainable rates. Resource governance defines budgets, thresholds, and escalation triggers that balance output quality against operational cost.</td>
