                <td>Define a structured sequence for restoring agent context at the start of every session. AI agents start each session with no memory of previous work. Context Recovery Protocol establishes a systematic loading sequence that brings agents up to speed efficiently: read governance first, then project state, then current priorities, then specific task context. The order matters because each layer informs the interpretation of the next.</td>

                <td>Invoke multiple specialized agents simultaneously for complex tasks that span multiple domains. Parallel Agent Dispatch is the human-AI equivalent of assembling a team for a mission: identify the domains involved, select the appropriate specialists, brief them simultaneously, and coordinate their parallel execution. This maximizes throughput by leveraging AI's ability to work on multiple fronts simultaneously.</td>

Session Rituals are not ceremony for ceremony's sake - they serve operational functions. A standup at session start ensures alignment on priorities. A closeout at session end ensures work is committed, documented, and ready for the next session. Consistency creates reliability.</td>

                <td>Structure task assignments using a standardized briefing format that ensures completeness. A Mission Briefing is a structured task assignment that includes: objective (what), context (why), constraints (boundaries), resources (what's available), success criteria (how you'll know it's done), and authority level (what decisions the agent can make autonomously). This format eliminates ambiguity and reduces the need for clarifying questions mid-task.</td>

                <td>Build a library of reusable, parameterized commands that trigger complex agent behaviors with simple invocations. Custom Commands encode frequently-used multi-step operations into single triggers. Instead of explaining a complex procedure every session, the team invokes a named command that expands into the full procedure. This reduces errors, saves time, and creates a shared operational vocabulary.</td>

Invocation Authority establishes which roles can activate which agents, preventing unauthorized use of specialized or sensitive capabilities. This is the access control layer for agent dispatch.</td>
