        <h1>Getting Started with F.O.R.G.E</h1>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 1: Understand the Matrix</h2>
            <p>The F.O.R.G.E matrix organizes agentic AI development methods into 8 tactical pillars. Start by reading the <a href="index.html">matrix overview</a> to understand the full scope of the framework.</p>
            <p>Each column represents a tactic (a strategic area of agentic AI development). Each cell within a column represents a method (a specific practice you can implement).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 2: Assess Your Current State</h2>
            <p>Walk through each tactic and honestly evaluate which methods your team already uses, partially implements, or hasn't considered. Most teams will find they're strong in some areas and have gaps in others.</p>
            <p><strong>Common patterns:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical teams</strong> tend to be strong in Execution and Quality but weak in Governance and Knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise teams</strong> tend to be strong in Governance but weak in Team Design and Evolution</li>
                <li><strong>Solo practitioners</strong> tend to be strong in Foundation but weak in everything that requires structure</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 3: Start with Foundation</h2>
            <p>The Foundation tactic (FT01) contains the philosophical underpinnings that inform everything else. If you don't have clarity on <em>why</em> you're collaborating with AI and <em>what</em> each party brings to the table, the operational methods won't stick.</p>
            <p>Key starting methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="techniques/fg-0101.html">FG-0101: Two-Layer Integration</a> - Understand what you bring vs. what AI brings</li>
                <li><a href="techniques/fg-0102.html">FG-0102: Agent Protection Policy</a> - Decide how you'll treat AI agents</li>
                <li><a href="techniques/fg-0103.html">FG-0103: People Over Process</a> - Set the right priorities</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 4: Establish Governance</h2>
            <p>Before scaling your AI collaboration, establish the rules. Without governance, AI agents will make decisions you didn't authorize, access information they shouldn't, and create chaos that scales faster than you can fix it.</p>
            <p>Minimum viable governance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="techniques/fg-0201.html">FG-0201: Authority Architecture</a> - Who has final say?</li>
                <li><a href="techniques/fg-0202.html">FG-0202: Operational Directives</a> - What rules are inviolable?</li>
                <li><a href="techniques/fg-0203.html">FG-0203: Trust Tiers</a> - What can each agent access?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 5: Design Your Team</h2>
            <p>One generalist AI agent will give you generalist results. Specialized agents with distinct roles create focused, higher-quality output and reduce the "well, it depends" hedging that comes from asking one entity to hold contradictory requirements.</p>
            <p>Start with <a href="techniques/fg-0301.html">FG-0301: Agent Specialization</a> and build from there.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 6: Build Knowledge Systems</h2>
            <p>The number one complaint about AI collaboration: "It doesn't remember anything." This is a solvable problem, but only if you build the systems to solve it. The Knowledge tactic (FT07) covers everything from session handoffs to institutional memory.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 7: Iterate</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E is not a checklist you complete once. It's a framework you grow into. Start with the methods that address your biggest pain points, measure the results, and expand from there. The Evolution tactic (FT08) covers how to track progress and adapt the framework to your needs.</p>

            <h2>Implementation Tiers</h2>
            <p>Adopt F.O.R.G.E at the level that matches your scale:</p>
