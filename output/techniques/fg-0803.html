            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Maintain the genuine, unpolished voice of the collaboration's participants in documentation and communication. AI has a tendency to sand down rough edges - making everything grammatically perfect, tonally neutral, and stylistically uniform. Authentic Voice Preservation is the deliberate practice of keeping the real voice: the typos that show speed, the humor that shows humanity, the self-deprecation that shows honesty. Authenticity builds trust in ways that polish cannot.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Establish that certain documentation categories preserve raw voice (blog posts, war stories, internal communications). Define which contexts require polished output (external documentation, formal communications) and which benefit from authentic voice. Train agents to preserve voice characteristics rather than correcting them. Review output for excessive polish that removes personality.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Internal documentation sounds like the team, not like a corporate communications department</li>
<li>External audiences connect with the authentic voice</li>
<li>War stories and journey documentation preserve the emotional texture of events</li>
<li>The team's personality is recognizable across their output</li>

                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Authentic voice in contexts that require professionalism</li>
<li>Preserving errors that impede comprehension (there's a line between charming typos and unreadable text)</li>
<li>Forcing authenticity - manufactured 'realness' that reads as fake</li>
<li>No distinction between contexts that benefit from polish vs. authenticity</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: Typos Are Part of the Charm</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team's leader typed fast - really fast - and the typos were legendary. Instead of polishing every communication, the team preserved the authentic voice in internal documentation and blog posts. Readers connected with it. The typos, the speed, the self-roasting humor - it read like a real person in the middle of building something, because it was. The authentic voice became the brand, and the brand built trust that no amount of corporate polish could have achieved.</div>
