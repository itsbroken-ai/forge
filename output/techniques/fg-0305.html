            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Establish clear protocols for how multiple humans and AI agents collaborate on shared work products. Multi-Contributor Workflow addresses the coordination challenges that emerge when more than one human and more than one AI agent are contributing to the same project. It defines attribution, review chains, conflict resolution, and how to maintain coherence when many contributors are active simultaneously.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define contribution attribution standards (e.g., Co-Authored-By headers). Establish review chains for multi-contributor work. Create conflict resolution protocols for when contributors disagree. Document how work is divided, how merges are handled, and how quality is maintained across contributors.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Contributions are attributed accurately across all contributors</li>
<li>Work products are coherent despite multiple contributors</li>
<li>Conflict resolution is handled through defined processes, not ad hoc</li>
<li>New contributors can join the workflow without disrupting existing work</li>

                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Unattributed contributions - can't trace decisions to their source</li>
<li>Inconsistent output across contributors - no coherence standards</li>
<li>Merge conflicts that destroy work because the resolution process is unclear</li>
<li>Contributor count exceeding coordination capacity</li>

                <h2>Field Report: The Attribution Standard</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team with ten AI agents and one human lead implemented strict attribution standards: every commit included Co-Authored-By headers, every design decision was logged with its author, and every review included the reviewer's identity. When auditing months of work, they could trace any line of code, any design decision, and any quality judgment to its source. The overhead was minimal; the traceability was invaluable.</div>
