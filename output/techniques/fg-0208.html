            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Implement continuous monitoring and threat detection for AI operations. AI agents operate at machine speed - they can create, modify, and delete faster than human oversight can follow in real-time. Security Operations establishes automated monitoring that watches for anomalous behavior, unauthorized access attempts, and policy violations. This is your SOC for human-AI collaboration.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define what constitutes anomalous agent behavior (unusual file access patterns, attempts to access sealed content, operations outside defined scope). Implement automated alerts for these patterns. Designate a security function - human or agent - responsible for monitoring and response. Review alerts regularly to tune signal vs. noise.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Anomalous behavior is detected and flagged automatically</li>
<li>Security events are logged with sufficient context for investigation</li>
<li>Alert fatigue is managed - alerts are meaningful, not overwhelming</li>
<li>The team has a defined incident response procedure</li>

                </ul>

            <section class="technique-failures">
                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Monitoring without response capability - detecting problems you can't act on</li>
<li>Over-alerting - so many false positives that real alerts are ignored</li>
<li>No monitoring at all - relying entirely on trust and after-the-fact discovery</li>
<li>Monitoring that degrades agent performance significantly</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: The Automated Watcher</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team deployed an automated monitoring system that watched agent operations for policy violations and anomalous behavior. In its first week, it caught three near-misses: an agent attempting to write to a protected directory, a session that exceeded its authorized scope, and a commit that would have included a credential file. Each was caught, logged, and resolved before any damage occurred.</div>
