            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ensure that every data artifact shipped by the collaboration has been intentionally designed, reviewed, and validated - never randomly generated or arbitrarily chosen. This technique eliminates &#x27;placeholder syndrome&#x27; where AI-generated sample data ships as production content.

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Establish a review step for all data artifacts: configuration files, sample data, test fixtures, and content. Define what &#x27;designed data&#x27; means for your domain (manually authored, reviewed for accuracy, validated against requirements). Flag and replace any generated data that shipped without review. Include data design in the asset review pipeline.</p>

                    <li>No placeholder or randomly-generated data in production</li>

<li>The team can explain why every data value was chosen</li>

                    <li>Treating data review as lower priority than code review</li>
<li>Not recognizing AI-generated sample data as placeholder</li>
<li>Data review bottleneck - reviewing data takes longer than generating it</li>
<li>Designed data that&#x27;s still wrong - reviewed but not validated</li>

Not random, not placeholder, not generated-and-forgotten. Every configuration value, every game encounter, every curriculum item was tested to confirm it was manually authored and reviewed. The test suite wasn&#x27;t just QA - it was a guarantee that no random data had slipped into production.</div>
