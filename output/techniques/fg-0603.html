            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Require new contributors (human or AI) to operate under enhanced review for a defined period before granting full autonomy. The Review Period is not about distrust - it is about calibration. New contributors need time to learn project conventions, and the team needs time to assess the contributor's quality, reliability, and alignment with project standards. The review period formalizes this mutual calibration.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define a review period length (1-4 weeks recommended). During this period, all contributions undergo enhanced review. Define clear graduation criteria: consistency with project standards, zero critical issues, demonstrated understanding of governance. Communicate the process transparently - this is calibration, not probation.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>New contributors produce higher-quality work after the review period</li>
<li>The team identifies and addresses contributor-specific issues early</li>
<li>Graduation criteria are clear and objective</li>
<li>Contributors view the period as supportive, not punitive</li>

                </ul>

            <section class="technique-failures">
                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Review period too long - contributor fatigue before graduation</li>
<li>Review period too short - issues not identified before autonomy is granted</li>
<li>No graduation criteria - review period becomes indefinite</li>
<li>Review without feedback - finding issues but not helping the contributor improve</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: The Two-Week Tempering</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team required every new agent to operate under enhanced review for two weeks. During this period, every commit was reviewed in detail, every design decision was questioned, and every output was compared against project standards. Agents that graduated from the review period produced measurably better work than agents that were given full autonomy immediately. The review period wasn't a barrier - it was an investment in quality that paid dividends across every subsequent session.</div>
