            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Implement multiple, independent backup mechanisms for all critical data and knowledge. In human-AI collaboration, context loss is the ever-present threat. A single backup is not a backup - it's a single point of failure. Redundant Backup Strategy ensures that critical knowledge exists in at least three independent locations, using at least two different mechanisms, with regular verification that backups are current and restorable.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Identify all critical data (source code, knowledge repositories, governance documents, session histories). Establish three backup locations using at least two different mechanisms (e.g., git + cloud sync + local copy). Automate backup where possible. Verify backup integrity monthly. Document restoration procedures and test them quarterly.</p>

                    <li>Critical data exists in 3+ independent locations</li>
<li>Backups are automated and verified regularly</li>
<li>Restoration procedures are documented and tested</li>
<li>The team has recovered from at least one data loss event using backups</li>

                    <li>Backups exist but have never been tested for restoration</li>
<li>All backups in the same location - single point of failure</li>
<li>Backups not current - restoring stale data</li>
<li>Backup procedures documented but not automated - relies on human memory</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">A repository corruption incident was resolved in under 15 minutes using the second of three redundant copies (development machine, remote repository, external drive). Without the backup protocol, estimated reconstruction time: 2-3 weeks. Post-incident analysis revealed the nightly backup cadence was sufficient for this incident but would have resulted in up to 24 hours of data loss. Backup frequency was subsequently increased for active development branches.</div>
