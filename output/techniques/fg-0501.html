            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Conduct structured planning sessions before building. Design Meetings follow a consistent format: present the problem, propose a solution, identify questions, make decisions, and get approval before writing code. This prevents the common failure mode of agents building the wrong thing quickly. The meeting format forces alignment between human intent and agent execution before resources are invested.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Before any non-trivial build task, conduct a structured design session: (1) Problem statement - what are we solving? (2) Proposed approach - how will we solve it? (3) Open questions - what don't we know? (4) Decisions - resolve the questions. (5) Approval - human confirms the approach. Document the outcome. Begin building only after approval.</p>

                    <li>Non-trivial tasks start with a design meeting, not code</li>
<li>Rework decreases because alignment happens before building</li>
<li>Design decisions are documented for future reference</li>
<li>The team spends more time building the right thing and less time rebuilding</li>

                    <p class="sub-method-desc">Begin every design meeting with a clear, concise problem statement: what are we solving, who is it for, and what does success look like? The problem statement prevents scope drift during the meeting and provides a decision filter for proposals. If a proposed solution doesn't address the problem statement, it's out of scope.</p>

                    <p class="sub-method-desc">Document every design meeting outcome in a structured format: problem, proposals considered, decision made, rationale, and open items.

This is not a rubber stamp — the human must confirm they understand and endorse the proposed approach. If the human has questions, the meeting continues.

                <h2>Field Report: Plan Before You Build</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team implemented mandatory design meetings after repeatedly building features that missed the mark. The format was simple: propose, question, decide, approve. The first week felt slow. By the second week, rework dropped by 60%. Agents stopped building things the human didn't want, and the human stopped receiving deliverables that needed complete rethinking. The time 'lost' to planning was recovered tenfold in reduced rework.</div>
