            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Conduct structured planning sessions before building. Design Meetings follow a consistent format: present the problem, propose a solution, identify questions, make decisions, and get approval before writing code. This prevents the common failure mode of agents building the wrong thing quickly. The meeting format forces alignment between human intent and agent execution before resources are invested.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Before any non-trivial build task, conduct a structured design session: (1) Problem statement — what are we solving? (2) Proposed approach — how will we solve it? (3) Open questions — what don't we know? (4) Decisions — resolve the questions. (5) Approval — human confirms the approach. Document the outcome. Begin building only after approval.</p>

                    <li>Non-trivial tasks start with a design meeting, not code</li>
<li>Rework decreases because alignment happens before building</li>
<li>Design decisions are documented for future reference</li>

                    <li>Design meetings for trivial tasks — overhead without value</li>
<li>Design meetings that don't produce decisions — just discussion</li>
<li>Skipping design meetings under time pressure — the exact time they're most needed</li>
<li>Design meeting outcomes not documented — decisions lost</li>

                <h2>Field Report: Plan Before You Build</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team implemented mandatory design meetings after repeatedly building features that missed the mark. The format was simple: propose, question, decide, approve. The first week felt slow. By the second week, rework dropped by 60%. Agents stopped building things the human didn't want, and the human stopped receiving deliverables that needed complete rethinking. The time 'lost' to planning was recovered tenfold in reduced rework.</div>
