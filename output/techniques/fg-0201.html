            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Define a clear, unambiguous hierarchy of authority. In any human-AI collaboration, there must be a single, identifiable authority who has final say on all decisions. This is not about control — it is about clarity. When an agent faces a decision that could have significant consequences, it must know exactly who has the authority to approve it. Authority Architecture eliminates the 'I thought you said it was okay' failure mode.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Designate a single authority (typically the human lead) with documented final decision rights. Define what decisions agents can make autonomously vs. what requires approval. Publish the authority chain so every participant — human and AI — knows who decides what. Update as the team scales.</p>

                    <li>Every team member can name the final authority for any decision type</li>
<li>Agents escalate appropriately rather than making unauthorized decisions</li>
<li>Decision-making speed increases because authority is clear, not because it is bypassed</li>
<li>No 'who approved this?' incidents</li>

                    <li>Authority too centralized — bottleneck on every decision</li>
<li>Authority ambiguous — multiple people think they have final say</li>
<li>Authority undocumented — exists informally but isn't known to agents</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">After an agent nearly made a destructive change to a shared repository, the team established a single, non-negotiable principle: one human holds absolute authority. Not because democracy is wrong, but because in a system where AI agents can execute at machine speed, someone must be unambiguously empowered to say stop. This single rule prevented every subsequent near-miss.</div>
