            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Maintain persistent directives that remain in effect across all sessions. Standing Orders are instructions that don't need to be repeated every session - they are always active. They cover recurring requirements like commit message format, code style, documentation standards, and behavioral expectations. Standing Orders reduce session startup overhead and ensure consistency even when context is limited.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Document 10-20 standing orders that cover the most common recurring requirements. Place them where agents read them at session start (project configuration files, system prompts, or reference documents). Review quarterly: remove orders that are no longer relevant, add orders for recurring issues. Keep each order to one actionable sentence.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Agents follow standing orders without being reminded</li>
<li>Common tasks are executed consistently across sessions</li>
<li>Session startup time decreases because standing context is already established</li>
<li>Standing orders evolve based on observed patterns, not assumptions</li>

                </ul>

            <section class="technique-failures">
                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Too many standing orders - cognitive overload prevents internalization</li>
<li>Standing orders that conflict with session-specific instructions</li>
<li>Orders never reviewed or updated - become stale and ignored</li>
<li>Standing orders used as a substitute for proper session context</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: The CLAUDE.md Pattern</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team embedded standing orders in project configuration files that agents read at every session start. Commit attribution format, code quality standards, directory organization rules, and testing requirements were all encoded as standing orders. New sessions started productive immediately because the baseline expectations were already loaded. When a standard changed, they updated one file and every subsequent session inherited the change.</div>
