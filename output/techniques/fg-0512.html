            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Defined procedures for detecting, containing, and recovering from agent errors during execution. Agents will produce incorrect output, corrupt state, exceed scope, and misinterpret instructions — not occasionally, but regularly. Error recovery protocols ensure that when failures occur, the response is systematic rather than ad hoc: detect the error, stop propagation, assess blast radius, restore to known good state, and document the incident for prevention.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define error categories (output quality failure, state corruption, scope violation, resource exhaustion) with specific detection criteria and recovery procedures for each. Implement checkpoints at natural boundaries in complex tasks. Establish rollback procedures for every operation that modifies shared state. Document recovery steps so they can be executed by any team member.</p>

                    <li>Errors are detected within minutes rather than discovered days later</li>
<li>Recovery from any error category takes less than 15 minutes</li>
<li>Rollback procedures exist and have been tested for all state-modifying operations</li>
<li>Error frequency decreases over time as patterns are identified and prevented</li>

                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>No checkpoints — errors compound through long execution chains before detection</li>
<li>Recovery procedures that exist on paper but have never been tested</li>
<li>Panic response — overreacting to errors by rolling back more than necessary or adding excessive process</li>
<li>Root cause neglect — recovering from the symptom without investigating why the error occurred</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">An agent executing a multi-file refactoring task introduced a naming inconsistency in file 3 of 12. Without intermediate checkpoints, the inconsistency propagated through files 4-12 before review. Recovery required reverting 10 files and re-executing from the checkpoint at file 3. Implementation of per-file verification checkpoints in subsequent tasks reduced cascading error incidents to zero. Time lost: 45 minutes. Estimated time saved by prevention in subsequent tasks: 6+ hours.</div>
