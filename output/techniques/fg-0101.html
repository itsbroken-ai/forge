            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The core thesis of effective human-AI collaboration: humans provide domain expertise, judgment, and creative direction; AI provides throughput, cross-domain breadth, and tireless execution. Neither layer is sufficient alone. The human&#x27;s 10, 20, or 30 years of domain knowledge is what makes the output good. The AI&#x27;s ability to operate across disciplines and produce volume is what makes the output possible. Two-Layer Integration is not about replacement - it is about unlocking capabilities that neither party could achieve independently.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define explicitly what the human brings to the collaboration (domain expertise, quality judgment, creative direction, ethical oversight) and what AI brings (speed, breadth, pattern recognition, execution capacity). Document this split for your specific domain. Revisit it quarterly as capabilities evolve.</p>

<li>Failing to apply domain expertise to AI output - leads to plausible-sounding but incorrect results</li>
<li>Over-relying on AI judgment for decisions requiring human accountability</li>
<li>Allowing the integration to calcify - failing to revisit the human-AI split as capabilities evolve, leading to stale role boundaries that no longer reflect reality</li>

The human&#x27;s vocabulary is literally the API between their expertise and AI execution speed. Include a vocabulary inventory: what terms does the human know precisely, and where are the vocabulary gaps that will slow collaboration? This makes the human layer explicit rather than assumed, preventing the common failure where AI-generated volume obscures the absence of domain depth.</p>
