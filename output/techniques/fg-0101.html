            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The core thesis of effective human-AI collaboration: humans provide domain expertise, judgment, and creative direction; AI provides throughput, cross-domain breadth, and tireless execution. Neither layer is sufficient alone. The human's 10, 20, or 30 years of domain knowledge is what makes the output good. The AI's ability to operate across disciplines and produce volume is what makes the output possible. Two-Layer Integration is not about replacement - it is about unlocking capabilities that neither party could achieve independently.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define explicitly what the human brings to the collaboration (domain expertise, quality judgment, creative direction, ethical oversight) and what AI brings (speed, breadth, pattern recognition, execution capacity). Document this split for your specific domain. Revisit it quarterly as capabilities evolve.</p>

                    <li>Team members can articulate what each layer contributes</li>
<li>Work products show evidence of both domain depth and AI-enabled breadth</li>
<li>Neither human nor AI work is treated as dispensable</li>

                    <li>Treating AI as a replacement rather than a complement - leads to shallow output</li>
<li>Failing to apply domain expertise to AI output - leads to plausible-sounding but incorrect results</li>
<li>Over-relying on AI judgment for decisions requiring human accountability</li>

                <h2>Field Report: 463,000 Words in 13 Days</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A human-AI team produced 463,000 words of documentation, a patent filing, multiple software products, and a comprehensive governance system in its first two weeks. The volume came from AI throughput. The quality came from 20 years of military command, red team operations, and engineering discipline applied as creative direction and quality control. Neither layer could have produced this alone.</div>
