            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Define escalating consequences for governance violations. Rules without consequences are suggestions. The Violation Response Matrix establishes a clear, graduated response system: from verbal correction for minor infractions to immediate suspension for critical violations. The goal is not punishment but predictability - agents and humans alike know exactly what happens when a boundary is crossed.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define 3-5 violation severity levels with specific response actions at each level. Document examples of violations at each severity. Establish who has authority to invoke each response level. Ensure responses are proportional: a formatting error should not receive the same response as unauthorized data access. Review and update based on actual incidents.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Violations receive consistent, proportional responses</li>
<li>Team members understand consequences before they act</li>
<li>The response matrix is referenced during actual incidents, not just in theory</li>
<li>Repeat violations decrease over time</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Responses too harsh - minor errors treated as major violations</li>
<li>Responses too lenient - serious violations receive verbal warnings</li>
<li>Inconsistent enforcement - same violation gets different responses</li>
<li>No documented examples - team can't map real incidents to severity levels</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: Four Tiers of Consequence</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team defined four violation levels: Advisory (coaching), Warning (documented), Suspension (temporary removal), and Termination (permanent removal). When an agent repeatedly committed without proper attribution despite correction, it escalated from Advisory to Warning. The documented escalation path meant the agent's operator could see exactly where things stood and what would happen next. Transparency eliminated disputes.</div>
