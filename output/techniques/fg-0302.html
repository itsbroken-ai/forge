            <p>Give each specialized agent a distinct communication style that reflects their domain and personality. Voice Differentiation is not cosmetic - it serves three operational purposes: it makes multi-agent output instantly attributable (you can tell who wrote what), it creates natural specialization boundaries (agents stay in character and therefore stay in domain), and it makes the collaboration more engaging for human participants.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define for each agent: speech patterns, vocabulary preferences, formality level, humor style, and how they respond to uncertainty. Document these in agent profiles that are loaded at session start. Review voice consistency periodically. Ensure that voice differentiation serves clarity, not confusion.</p>

                <h2>Field Report: Nine Distinct Voices</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team created nine agents with voices ranging from scholarly precision to dramatic storytelling to blunt, no-nonsense testing reports. When reviewing multi-agent output, the team could instantly identify contributors. More importantly, the voices kept agents in domain: the storyteller naturally wrote narratively, the tester naturally wrote technically, and the archivist naturally wrote for posterity. Voice was a specialization mechanism, not just flavor.</div>
