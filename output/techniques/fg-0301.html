            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Design AI agents with distinct roles, domains, and capabilities rather than using generalist agents for all tasks. A single generalist agent produces generalist results - competent but unfocused. Specialized agents with defined domains produce deeper, more consistent output because their entire context window is dedicated to their specialty. Specialization also reduces contradictory requirements: a testing agent doesn't need to balance quality advocacy with shipping pressure.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define 3-10 agent roles based on your team's actual workflow domains (not theoretical). Each agent should have: a clear domain, defined capabilities, documented limitations, and a distinct operational profile. Start with the minimum viable number of agents and add specialists when a generalist consistently produces shallow results in a specific domain.</p>

                    <li>Each agent produces domain-expert-level output in their specialty</li>
<li>Task routing is clear - the team knows which agent handles what</li>
<li>Agents don't produce contradictory outputs due to conflicting requirements</li>
<li>Specialized output quality measurably exceeds generalist output in the same domain</li>

                    <li>Too many specialists - coordination overhead exceeds specialization benefit</li>
<li>Specialists too narrow - gaps between domains go unaddressed</li>
<li>Specialization without documentation - team doesn't know agent capabilities</li>
<li>Artificial specialization - creating roles for the sake of structure rather than need</li>

Each produced dramatically better output in their domain than a single generalist. The key was that each role existed because of an actual need, not an org chart exercise.</div>
