            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Maintain comprehensive, searchable records of all significant actions, decisions, and changes. An Audit Trail is not just for compliance - it is for learning. When something goes wrong, the audit trail enables root cause analysis. When something goes right, it enables pattern replication. Every significant action should leave a mark in the record: who did it, what they did, why they did it, and when.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define what constitutes a &#x27;significant action&#x27; (commits, configuration changes, access grants, policy changes, incident responses). Establish a logging format that captures actor, action, context, and timestamp. Store logs in a searchable, persistent system. Review logs periodically to identify patterns. Use log data to improve processes.</p>

<li>Inconsistent logging - some actions captured, others missed</li>
<li>Audit data not accessible when needed - stored but not searchable</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">A team maintained an activity log that recorded every session: who participated, what was accomplished, what decisions were made, and what was deferred. When a bug surfaced three weeks after introduction, the activity log allowed them to trace it to a specific session, a specific agent, and a specific decision. The fix took minutes because finding the cause took seconds. Without the log, they&#x27;d still be searching.</div>
