            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Implement progressive access levels based on demonstrated reliability. Not all agents should have the same access from day one. Trust Tiers establish a graduated system where agents begin with limited access and earn expanded capabilities through demonstrated competence and reliability. This mirrors security clearance models: access is granted based on need and earned through trust, not assumed by default.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define 3-5 trust levels with specific capabilities at each tier. New agents start at the lowest tier. Define clear criteria for advancement (e.g., X sessions without incidents, demonstrated competence in specific tasks). Document what each tier can access, modify, and decide. Implement technical controls where possible, procedural controls where not.</p>

<li>Agent capabilities expand predictably as trust is earned</li>

<li>No advancement path - agents stuck at low trust with no way to earn more</li>
<li>Trust levels exist on paper but aren't enforced technically</li>
