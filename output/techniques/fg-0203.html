            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Implement progressive access levels based on demonstrated reliability. Not all agents should have the same access from day one. Trust Tiers establish a graduated system where agents begin with limited access and earn expanded capabilities through demonstrated competence and reliability. This mirrors security clearance models: access is granted based on need and earned through trust, not assumed by default.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Define 3-5 trust levels with specific capabilities at each tier. New agents start at the lowest tier. Define clear criteria for advancement (e.g., X sessions without incidents, demonstrated competence in specific tasks). Document what each tier can access, modify, and decide. Implement technical controls where possible, procedural controls where not.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>New agents operate safely within constrained boundaries</li>
<li>Agent capabilities expand predictably as trust is earned</li>
<li>Incidents decrease because risky operations require elevated trust</li>
<li>Trust levels are documented, not informal</li>

                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Too many tiers — administrative overhead exceeds security benefit</li>
<li>No advancement path — agents stuck at low trust with no way to earn more</li>
<li>Trust levels exist on paper but aren't enforced technically</li>
<li>Blanket trust grants that bypass the tier system</li>

                <h2>Field Report: From Observer to Operator</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team implemented five trust tiers: Observer (read-only), Contributor (write with review), Trusted (autonomous in domain), Elevated (cross-domain access), and Core (system-level operations). New agents started as Contributors with a two-week review period. The progression was earned, not granted — and the agents that advanced produced the highest quality work because they understood the system before they could change it.</div>
