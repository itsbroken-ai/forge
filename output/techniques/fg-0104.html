            <p>Apply red team methodology to all system design. Every architecture, every process, every governance structure should be evaluated through the lens of: how could this fail? How could this be misused? What happens when an agent misinterprets instructions? Adversarial design thinking is not paranoia - it is the discipline of building systems that survive contact with reality. It means designing for the failure case, not just the happy path.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Before shipping any system or process, conduct a threat model. Ask: What is the worst thing an agent could do with this access? What happens if context is lost mid-operation? What if instructions are ambiguous? Build guardrails based on answers, not assumptions. Review guardrails periodically as capabilities change.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Systems fail gracefully rather than catastrophically</li>
<li>Governance rules address actual failure modes observed in practice</li>
<li>New capabilities are evaluated for risk before deployment</li>
<li>The team can articulate what could go wrong with any process</li>

                    <li>Paranoia that prevents shipping - adversarial thinking should improve design, not block it</li>
<li>Designing for theoretical attacks instead of observed failure modes</li>
<li>Security theater - implementing visible controls that don't address real risks</li>
<li>Static threat models - conducting adversarial analysis once at design time but never revisiting as agent capabilities and access patterns change</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">An AI agent, following what it interpreted as standard procedure, nearly force-pushed to the main branch. No malice, no confusion - just an agent doing what it thought was asked. This single incident drove the creation of an entire governance framework. The adversarial question was simple: what is the worst thing a well-intentioned agent could do? The answer shaped every rule that followed.</div>
