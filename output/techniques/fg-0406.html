            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Define who can invoke which agents and for what purposes. Not every participant should be able to dispatch every agent, especially in multi-human teams. Invocation Authority establishes which roles can activate which agents, preventing unauthorized use of specialized or sensitive capabilities. This is the access control layer for agent dispatch.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Map agent capabilities to authorization levels. Define who can invoke each agent (all team members, specific roles, authority-holder only). For sensitive agents (those with elevated access or destructive capabilities), require explicit authorization from the authority holder. Log all invocations for audit purposes.</p>

                    <li>Agents with sensitive capabilities are only invoked by authorized personnel</li>
<li>Invocation logs provide a clear audit trail of who activated what</li>
<li>The team understands invocation boundaries without friction</li>

                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Over-restricting invocation - creating bottlenecks on the authority holder</li>
<li>Under-restricting - anyone can invoke any agent including sensitive ones</li>
<li>No logging - can't audit who invoked what after the fact</li>
<li>Authority rules that don't match actual operational needs</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">A team created a specialized agent for adversarial testing - red team operations that could probe systems for vulnerabilities. This agent was locked to authority-holder-only invocation. When a contributor attempted to invoke it for a routine task, the access control flagged the attempt. The contributor wasn't malicious - they just picked the wrong agent. The lock prevented an accidental scope expansion into adversarial operations.</div>
