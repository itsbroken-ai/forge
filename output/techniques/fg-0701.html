            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Maintain a structured, versioned record of project history including plans, decisions, and health metrics. The history system is more than a changelog - it is the institutional memory of the collaboration. It records not just what happened, but why decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and what the team learned. When context is lost (as it inevitably is in AI collaboration), the history system provides recovery.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Create a structured project history system with clear organization. Include mechanisms for quick scanning of current state, tracking of active and completed work, and archival of deferred plans. Ensure entries are structured for fast retrieval. Update at session end and use as a primary input during context recovery.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>The history system accurately reflects current project state</li>
<li>Context recovery starts with history review</li>
<li>Decision rationale is preserved and accessible</li>
<li>The history system is updated consistently, not sporadically</li>

                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>History not updated - becomes stale and untrustworthy</li>
<li>History too detailed - quick scanning is impossible</li>
<li>History maintained by one person - single point of failure</li>
<li>History disconnected from actual work - a separate document nobody reads</li>

                    <p class="sub-method-desc">Every history document gets machine-readable frontmatter with standardized fields: plan name, status, owner, key decision, and date. This enables fast scanning — agents can read frontmatter (under 50 tokens) to determine relevance before committing to reading the full document (500+ tokens). Frontmatter is the index layer of the history system.</p>
