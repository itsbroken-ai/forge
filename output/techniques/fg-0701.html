            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Maintain a structured, versioned record of project history including plans, decisions, and health metrics. The Chronicle is more than a changelog — it is the institutional memory of the collaboration. It records not just what happened, but why decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and what the team learned. When context is lost (as it inevitably is in AI collaboration), the Chronicle provides recovery.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Create a Chronicle structure with: an index (quick reference to all entries), active plans (current work), completed plans (shipped work with summaries), and an archive (deferred work). Each entry should include YAML frontmatter for quick scanning: plan name, status, owner, key decisions. Update the Chronicle at session end. Use it as the first read during context recovery.</p>

                    <li>The Chronicle accurately reflects current project state</li>
<li>Context recovery starts with Chronicle reading</li>

<li>The Chronicle is updated consistently, not sporadically</li>

                    <li>Chronicle not updated — becomes stale and untrustworthy</li>
<li>Chronicle too detailed — quick scanning is impossible</li>
<li>Chronicle maintained by one person — single point of failure</li>
<li>Chronicle disconnected from actual work — a separate document nobody reads</li>

                <h2>Field Report: The Fast-Scan Protocol</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team's Chronicle used YAML frontmatter in every entry: plan name, status, owner, key decision — all scannable in under 20 tokens. An agent could scan the Chronicle index, identify the current state, and begin productive work in under a minute. When plans were completed, they moved to the 'Complete' directory with a summary. When plans were deferred, they moved to 'Archive' with the rationale. The Chronicle was the single source of truth that survived every context reset.</div>
