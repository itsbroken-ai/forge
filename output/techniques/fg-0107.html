            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Structure learning and skill development around challenges rather than tutorials. The most effective way to build human-AI collaboration competency is through doing, not reading. Design onboarding, training, and skill development as progressively difficult challenges that require applying techniques in realistic contexts. The lesson is embedded in the challenge, not delivered separately.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Create tiered challenges that exercise collaboration techniques in context. Start with basic invocation and context setting, progress to multi-agent coordination, governance edge cases, and complex mission execution. Each challenge should teach by requiring the technique, not by explaining it.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>New team members achieve competency through practice, not just documentation</li>
<li>Challenges exercise real techniques in realistic scenarios</li>
<li>Skill progression is measurable through challenge completion</li>
<li>The gap between training and production work is minimal</li>

                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Challenges too abstract to transfer to real work</li>
<li>Insufficient scaffolding for beginners - frustration instead of learning</li>
<li>Treating challenges as one-time events rather than ongoing skill development</li>
<li>Challenge inflation - continuously increasing difficulty without consolidating fundamentals, producing practitioners who can handle edge cases but fumble basic operations</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: Structured Challenge Progression</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A six-chapter challenge curriculum was deployed with escalating complexity across 15 distinct interaction types. Contributors who completed the challenge track demonstrated measurably higher proficiency in multi-agent coordination than those onboarded through documentation alone. Key finding: skill transfer occurred at the interaction-type boundary — each new challenge format exercised a distinct capability that passive reading did not develop.</div>
