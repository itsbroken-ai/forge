            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Document significant decisions with their context, rationale, alternatives considered, and expected consequences. Decisions without documented rationale become mysterious over time — the team knows what was decided but not why, making it impossible to evaluate whether the decision is still appropriate. Decision Records preserve the thinking behind choices so they can be revisited intelligently.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Create a decision record template with: Context (the situation that required a decision), Decision (what was decided), Rationale (why this option was chosen), Alternatives (what else was considered and why it was rejected), Consequences (expected outcomes). Record decisions when they're made, not after the fact. Store in the Chronicle or institutional memory repository.</p>

                    <li>Recording decisions after the fact — rationale is reconstructed, not captured</li>

<li>Decision records not findable when needed</li>
<li>Treating all decisions equally — trivial decisions documented with same rigor as critical ones</li>

                <h2>Field Report: Why We Chose Seven</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team documented why their governance had exactly seven directives — not five, not ten, seven. The decision record captured: the initial draft had twelve directives, but testing showed agents couldn't internalize more than seven consistently. Five was too few to cover the threat model. The record noted which five directives were cut and why. When a new team member later suggested adding an eighth directive, the record explained why seven was the deliberate limit — saving a re-litigation of a settled question.</div>
