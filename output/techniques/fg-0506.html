            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Structure learning content and skill development in progressive chapters that build competency through escalating complexity. Each chapter introduces concepts, reinforces through practice, and culminates in a capstone that requires synthesizing everything learned. This applies to both human team member development and designing training materials for others adopting the methodology.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Organize content into 4-8 progressive chapters. Each chapter should: introduce 3-5 new concepts, provide practice opportunities for each, and culminate in a synthesis challenge. Ensure prerequisites are explicit - no chapter assumes knowledge not covered in prior chapters. Test the progression with new learners to identify gaps.</p>

                <div class="war-story-content">A multi-chapter curriculum underwent three revision cycles driven by contributor failure data. Revision 1 addressed prerequisite gaps — contributors failed Chapter 3 challenges because Chapter 2 did not cover required concepts. Revision 2 addressed pacing — early encounters resolved too slowly, causing disengagement before skill acquisition. Revision 3 addressed interaction type distribution — consecutive encounters of the same type produced skill plateaus. Each revision was data-driven, not theoretical.</div>
