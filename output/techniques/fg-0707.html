            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Strategic management of what information occupies the finite context window available to AI agents during a session. The context window is the single most important technical constraint in AI collaboration — it determines what the agent knows, what it has forgotten, and what it will hallucinate to fill gaps. Effective context window management prioritizes high-value information, removes stale context, and structures loading sequences to maximize signal-to-noise ratio within the available token budget.</p>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Audit the token cost of every piece of context loaded at session start. Rank context by utility: governance rules and active task state first, reference material and historical context second, supplementary material last. Implement progressive loading — start with essential context and add detail only when the task requires it. Monitor for context window pressure indicators: agents repeating themselves, forgetting earlier instructions, or producing output inconsistent with loaded context.</p>

                <h2>Success Indicators</h2>
                <ul class="indicator-list">
                    <li>Agents operate within their effective context window without degradation</li>
<li>Context loading is prioritized by task relevance, not loading order habit</li>
<li>Stale or irrelevant context is identified and removed between task phases</li>
<li>The team can articulate the token cost of their standard context loading</li>

            <section class="technique-failures">
                <h2>Failure Modes</h2>
                <ul class="failure-list">
                    <li>Loading everything — filling the context window with comprehensive but low-relevance material, leaving no room for task execution</li>
<li>No prioritization — treating all context as equally important, resulting in critical information pushed out by volume</li>
<li>Ignoring degradation signals — continuing to add context after agents show signs of window pressure</li>
<li>Static loading — using the same context loading regardless of task type</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Field Report: Context Saturation Detection</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">Performance degradation was observed in sessions where agents received full project documentation at startup: output quality declined after the third major task, agents contradicted earlier instructions, and hallucination frequency increased. Token analysis revealed standard context loading consumed 68% of the effective context window before any task execution began. Implementing task-specific context profiles — loading only governance plus task-relevant material — reduced baseline consumption to 31% and eliminated the observed degradation pattern.</div>
