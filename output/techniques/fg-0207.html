            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Plan for continuity when key participants become unavailable. What happens when the primary human lead is unavailable? What happens when a critical AI agent's model is deprecated? Succession Protocol ensures that the collaboration can continue operating — perhaps at reduced capacity — when key participants are absent. This is not pessimism; it is operational planning.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Identify single points of failure in your collaboration (key humans, critical agents, essential tools). For each, document: what they do that others cannot, what knowledge they hold exclusively, and who or what would take over their functions. Test succession plans periodically by operating without the key participant.</p>

If the primary lead was unavailable, documented procedures existed for the next in line to assume decision authority. When the lead took an unexpected day off, the team continued operating without interruption because everyone already knew who had authority and what processes to follow.</div>
