            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Categorize and document distinct types of human-AI interactions for appropriate application. Not every interaction with an AI agent is the same type. Some are building sessions, some are review sessions, some are research, some are debugging, some are creative exploration. Recognizing and naming these patterns allows teams to match the right interaction type to the right task and set appropriate expectations for each.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="technique-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Identify 8-15 distinct interaction patterns your team uses regularly. Name each pattern and document: when to use it, what it produces, how long it typically takes, what makes it succeed or fail. Train the team to recognize which pattern fits a given task. Track pattern usage to identify which are most valuable.</p>

                    <li>The team has a shared vocabulary for interaction types</li>
<li>Tasks are matched to appropriate interaction patterns</li>
<li>New interaction patterns are recognized and documented as they emerge</li>
<li>Pattern selection improves task outcomes compared to unstructured interaction</li>

                    <li>Too many patterns - taxonomy becomes unwieldy</li>
<li>Patterns too rigid - force interactions into wrong shapes</li>
<li>Patterns not used - exist in documentation but not in practice</li>
<li>Patterns defined theoretically instead of from observed practice</li>

                <h2>Field Report: From Three to Many</h2>
                <div class="war-story-content">A team started with three interaction types: build, review, and discuss. Within two weeks, they had identified over a dozen distinct patterns - intensive multi-hour builds, competitive testing sessions, focused repair work, and others. Naming these patterns allowed the team to set expectations (&#x27;this is intensive, plan for three hours&#x27;) instead of vaguely &#x27;let&#x27;s work on this.&#x27; Expectations matched reality because named patterns set context.</div>
