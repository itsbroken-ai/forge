            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Systematically map existing domain expertise to AI collaboration patterns. Military command structures become agent governance. QA engineering becomes AI output validation. Project management becomes mission briefing protocols. Every established discipline contains patterns that transfer directly to human-AI collaboration - but only if you deliberately identify and adapt them rather than starting from scratch.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Inventory your team&#x27;s domain expertise. For each discipline, identify: What structures exist? What terminology is used? What processes are proven? Map each to an AI collaboration equivalent. Document the mapping so the team understands why a process exists, not just what it is.</p>

                    <li>AI collaboration processes feel natural to domain experts</li>
<li>Terminology bridges existing expertise and AI concepts</li>

<li>Over-mapping: not every military concept needs an AI equivalent</li>
<li>Failing to adapt transferred patterns to the AI context</li>
<li>Expertise gatekeeping - requiring deep domain background before allowing any contribution, turning a strength into an exclusion mechanism that blocks fresh perspectives</li>

Building vocabulary bridges between domains accelerates learning by anchoring new terms to familiar concepts. The bridge is the fastest path to naming precision in unfamiliar territory.</p>

                <div class="war-story-content">A team leader with 20 years of military command experience built an AI collaboration framework. Without consciously mapping it, every structure echoed military doctrine: invocations were mission briefs, session handoffs were shift-change briefs, standing orders were standing orders, trust tiers were clearance levels. The patterns transferred because the underlying problem - coordinating distributed teams under uncertainty - was identical.</div>
