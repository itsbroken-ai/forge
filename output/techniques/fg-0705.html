            <p>Systematically capture and preserve war stories, breakthroughs, failures, and journey documentation. The collaboration's story - the messy, real, human story of building with AI - is itself valuable content. Journey Preservation ensures that significant moments are captured in real-time: the bug that led to a governance overhaul, the breakthrough that unlocked a new capability, the failure that taught the most important lesson.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Create a trigger system for capturing significant moments: breakthroughs, failures, funny incidents, lessons learned. Capture in real-time, not after the fact - the details fade quickly. Store in a persistent collection with enough context to reconstruct the story later. Tag by theme for retrieval. Review periodically for content that can be shared externally.</p>

                    <li>Significant moments are captured when they happen</li>

<li>Capturing too late - details lost between the event and the recording</li>
<li>Stories captured but never used - a collection nobody reads</li>

                <div class="war-story-content">A team implemented a single-command insight capture mechanism that persisted conversation highlights to permanent storage on invocation. Over a 30-day period, the command was invoked 30+ times, producing a curated collection of insights, breakthrough moments, and contextual observations. This collection became primary source material for publications and presentations. Key metric: average capture time was under 5 seconds per invocation. Without the mechanism, equivalent insights were lost between sessions at an estimated rate of 3-5 per week.</div>
