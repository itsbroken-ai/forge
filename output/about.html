            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Everyone is building with AI agents. Nobody agrees on how.</p>
            <p>Vendors ship runtimes and APIs. Researchers publish theoretical frameworks. But practitioners - the people actually deploying agentic AI into production - have no shared vocabulary, no structured methodology, and no way to evaluate whether their approach will survive contact with reality.</p>
            <p>When an AI agent nearly force-pushed to a production repository, there was no playbook for what governance should look like. When a ten-agent team needed to coordinate across domains, there was no established pattern for parallel dispatch. When sessions reset and context evaporated, there was no standard for knowledge persistence.</p>
            <p>We built all of it from scratch. Then we organized what we learned so nobody else has to.</p>

            <h2>What F.O.R.G.E Is</h2>
            <p><strong>F.O.R.G.E</strong> (Framework for Organized, Resilient, Governed Engineering and Development of Agentic AI) is an Agentic AI Creation Framework. It provides 52 techniques organized across 8 tactical pillars - a structured, navigable taxonomy for building, governing, and scaling AI agent systems at any level of application.</p>
            <p>Modeled after <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</strong> - the framework that gave cybersecurity a common language for adversary behavior - F.O.R.G.E gives agentic AI a common language for <em>building</em> behavior. Each technique is specific, actionable, and comes with implementation guidance, success indicators, failure modes, and a field report from real-world use.</p>
            <p>This is not theory. Every technique exists because something went right - or more often, because something went wrong and we built the system to prevent it from happening again.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Who It's For</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E scales to any level of agentic AI application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solo practitioners</strong> running 1-3 AI agents: Start with Foundation and Knowledge (~10 core techniques)</li>
                <li><strong>Teams</strong> of 2-5 humans with multiple agents: Add Governance and Team Design (~25 techniques)</li>
                <li><strong>Organizations</strong> running scaled AI operations: Implement the full framework (all 52 techniques)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are using AI agents in production - or planning to - F.O.R.G.E gives you the vocabulary and the playbook.</p>

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E was developed by Pete McKernan, drawing from 20 years of operational experience: military command (92 Marines in combat operations), red team operations at the highest classification levels, QA engineering, adversarial security research, and game design.</p>
            <p>The methodology was forged - literally - during the first two weeks of running a production agentic AI team: 10 specialized agents, 463,000 words of output, a patent filing, multiple software products, and a governance system built because an agent almost destroyed a repository.</p>
            <p>Every structure in F.O.R.G.E maps to proven patterns from domains where getting it wrong has real consequences. Trust tiers are security clearances. Mission briefings are agent invocations. Standing orders are persistent directives. Session handoffs are shift-change briefs. The patterns transfer because the underlying problem - coordinating distributed teams under uncertainty - is identical.</p>

            <h2>Framework Structure</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E uses a matrix structure inspired by MITRE ATT&amp;CK:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tactics</strong> (columns) represent the 8 strategic pillars of agentic AI development</li>
                <li><strong>Techniques</strong> (cells) represent 52 specific practices within each tactic</li>
                <li>Each technique includes a description, implementation guide, success indicators, failure modes, and a field report</li>
                <li>Techniques are identified by ID (e.g., FG-0101) for precise cross-referencing</li>
