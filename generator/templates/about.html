        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What Is F.O.R.G.E?</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E (Framework for Organized, Resilient, Governed Engineering and Development of Agentic AI) is a structured methodology for building, governing, and scaling AI agent systems. It provides a taxonomy of {{TOTAL_TECHNIQUES}} techniques organized across {{TOTAL_TACTICS}} tactical pillars, giving teams a common vocabulary and proven practices for agentic AI development at every level of application.</p>
            <p>Modeled after frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;CK, F.O.R.G.E organizes practitioner knowledge into an interactive matrix where each technique represents a specific, actionable practice that teams can adopt, adapt, and measure.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Why F.O.R.G.E Exists</h2>
            <p>Agentic AI development is no longer experimental. Teams across every industry are deploying AI agents into production workflows. But there is no standardized framework for <em>how</em> to build, govern, and scale these systems effectively. Academic frameworks exist but are theoretical. Vendor documentation covers tools, not methodology.</p>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E fills this gap. It captures operational knowledge from teams that have built production agentic AI systems, organized into a navigable, referenceable structure that any team can use - from solo practitioners to enterprise organizations.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E was developed by Pete McKernan and his agentic AI development team, a collaboration that produced 463,000 words of documentation, a patent filing, multiple software products, and a comprehensive governance system in its first two weeks of operation. The methodology draws from 20 years of military command, red team operations, QA engineering, and game design.</p>
            <p>The team's own operations serve as the reference implementation of F.O.R.G.E. The framework itself is designed to be universal - applicable to any agentic AI system at any scale.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Framework Structure</h2>
            <p>F.O.R.G.E uses a matrix structure inspired by MITRE ATT&amp;CK:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tactics</strong> (columns) represent the strategic pillars of agentic AI development</li>
                <li><strong>Techniques</strong> (cells) represent specific practices within each tactic</li>
                <li>Each technique includes a description, implementation guide, success indicators, failure modes, and a field report from real-world use</li>
                <li>Techniques are identified by ID (e.g., FG-0101) for precise reference</li>
            </ul>
